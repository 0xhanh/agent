# Deployment with Balena

If you're looking for a way to quickly and easily get up and running with an Kerberos Agent for your home network, this is the project for you.

We provide two mechanisms to deploy Kerberos Agent to your Balena Cloud fleet:

1. Use Kerberos Agent as [a block part of your larger application](https://github.com/kerberos-io/balena-agent-block).
2. Use Kerberos Agent as [a stand-a-lone application](https://github.com/kerberos-io/balena-agent).
